Based on the Mangadex Downloader by [manusef](https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader), this is just a simple wrapper around their python library to make it a bit more user-friendly, instead of having to remember the command every couple of months when you wanna update your repository of manga!

Future updates, if i can expend the effort to get around to doing it include, but is not limited to:
* Keeping track of what version it last grabbed (i.e. "end" becomes last known, and then it checks for any newer versions past that version")
* Possible api integrations with mangadex to pull the mangas you saved there instead (dunno if possible... but yours already has it, so should just be a matter of doing the right calls to your library)
* Better-looking UI than the console-text, as well as exposing more options like the file type to save as or languages (maybe streamlit?)

Yes, I know the code isn't great. I'm self taught, and use Python occasionally for random stuff and quick-n-dirty scripts. Don't expect highly efficient code, or smart coding tricks etc, I'm probably just not aware of it at all.
